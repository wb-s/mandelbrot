# Mandlebrot

The **Mandlebrot Set** is the set of complex numbers $c$ such that iterations of $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ do not diverge to infinity. Colorizations of the rate of divergence for points $c$ on the complex plane yield enchanting, infinitely labyrinthine ornamentations.

This is a program for a Mandlebrot Set viewer in Java.

If you have Java enabled, you can run the project to view the Mandlebrot Set. Click areas to zoom and press the left arrow key to go back.
