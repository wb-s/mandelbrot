# mandlebrot

The **Mandlebrot Set** is the set of complex numbers c such that iterations of $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ do not diverge to infinity. Colorizations of the rate of divergence for points $c$ on the complex plane yield amusing, infinitely labyrinthine ornamentations.

This is a program for a simple Mandlebrot Set viewer in Java.

If you have Java enabled, you can run the project, click areas to zoom, and/or press the left arrow key to go back.
